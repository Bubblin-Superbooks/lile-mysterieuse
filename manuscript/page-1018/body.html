The shot, passing over the islet, fell into the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with exactitude.</p><p>The second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam Point, and the shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from Granite House, made it fly into splinters. It was Herbert who had pointed this gun and fired it, and very proud he was of his first shot. Pencroft only was prouder than he! Such a shot, the honor of which belonged to his dear boy.</p><p>The third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper side of Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles, then having ricocheted: was lost in the sea in a cloud of spray.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For the fourth piece Cyrus Harding slightly</p></div> </div>
