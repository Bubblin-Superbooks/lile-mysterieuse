It is one of those errors which some admire, others blame; which God alone can judge. He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be right may be an enemy, but retains our esteem. Your error is one that we may admire, and your name has nothing to fear from the judgment of history, which does not condemn heroic folly, but its results.”</p><p>The old man’s breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand to heaven,—</p><p>“Was I wrong, or in the right?” he murmured.</p><p>Cyrus Harding replied, “All great actions return to God, from whom they are derived. Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored, shall ever mourn your loss.”</p></div> </div>
