All around, the lonely sea extended to the limits of the horizon. No land nor even a sail was in sight.</p><p>This woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of Lincoln Island, arid and wild in one part, but fertile and rich in the other. On the contrary this was a uniform mass of verdure, out of which rose two or three hills of no great height. Obliquely to the oval of the island ran a stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a narrow mouth.</p><p>“The domain is limited,” said Herbert.</p></div> </div>
